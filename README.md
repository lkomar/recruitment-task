Welcome! This is my approach to the task I got from a great guy that wrote to me on LinkedIn üòÅ. I decided to give it a go since the stack looks quite awesome üî•. I'm a huge fan of dark mode! With that in mind I added some basic styling for it, but let the browser defaults decide which to present. I didn't use Cypress for testing before so I decided I'll learn something new even though next projects tend to use React Testing Library with Jest in order to do that.

## Launching the app locally

I got some preferences, but I leave the choice up to you. I decided to stick with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), so I'll try to keep things consistent. I assume you're experienced with console, but just in case I'll leave some key information below.

First, remember to install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

or

```
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the app.

## Testing

If you want to run tests for the app, simply run

```
yarn test
```
